His first show was at the IEEE annual banquet and featured a self-built single color laser projector and used function generators out of the college lab to perform live abstracts to music. Intrigued with how laser projectors work, Jason started building his own systems in his garage.",
      "In 2013 Jason built his first full color RGB system. This was also the first system that interfaced with control software providing recording capabilities. Using Mathematics and Science, Jason was able to transform a laser into an artistic display of abstract colors and patterns and sync it to music. Learning about various hardware and software platforms Jason decided to build a custom live performance console. The console features old school analog controls, as well as new school digital controls.",
      "Jason made his debut into the professional scene in 2017 by winning first place for abstract show, at the International Laser Display Association annual conference. He followed up the next year in 2018 by winning first place a second time for the best abstract show.",

      "Roman Keith Hines has been in the entertainment industry since 1984. His family owned a roller skating rink in Hillsborough, North Carolina where he started spinning records and serving as the rink dee-jay. Realizing his passion and strength, Roman went to broadcasting school in 1987 at Lenoir Community College in Kinston. While in broadcasting school, he worked for 106.5 WSFL (New Bern) and 90.5 WKNS (Kinston). After broadcasting school, Roman returned home to Durham where he became a dee-jay at WDNC (620 AM). In 1991, he opened his own mobile dee-jay company under the name Sights and Sounds. To supplement his income, he signed on as a teacher's assistant in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.",
      "Sights and Sounds started doing mostly school dances. Over time, the company specialized in professional lighting, including lasers. This set Sights and Sounds apart from other companies, which secured higher end laser light dance parties, often hosting thousands of people. The addition of the lights gave Sights and Sounds the opportunity to provide lighting at concerts of all kinds, including KC and the Sunshine Band, Technotronic, Crystal Waters, and Kool And the Gang.",
      "Roman's passion is working with youth as he is highly sought after for everything from small birthday parties to large high school proms. His enthusiasm and constant interaction with the crowd make him a favorite with everyone at the party.",
      "Roman takes pride in sharing his life story with others as a way to show youth what they can accomplish. As a child, Roman was diagnosed with a processing learning disability and dyscalculia. He had great difficulty with organization, mathematics, hearing the teacher, and often \"just felt clueless.\" School was a struggle for much of his life. After attending the Hill Learning Development Center in Durham, he learned how to adjust. While he struggled in English and Math, Roman always wanted to work in entertainment and thus began to read about the subject. Through mostly self-study, Roman learned the trade which allowed him to start his own business of Sights and Sounds.",
      "Roman shares this story of his youth with others because he wants kids who struggle with any disability to realize that they are capable of finding a marketable strength with which they can make a difference and make a living. Roman is based in Durham."
