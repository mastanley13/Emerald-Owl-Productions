**CELEBRATE AMERICA LASER SHOW**
*Shows Start at $7,676.76*

## Introduction
Emerald Owl Productions is designing a special laser show to celebrate America's 250th Anniversary in 2026.

This one-of-a-kind experience will feature brilliant laser beams projecting over your audience, all choreographed to a mix of patriotic music, famous quotes, and a journey through some of the greatest decades in American music history.

## Show Details

### Customizable Show Length
The show length is fully customizable. Our standard version runs 30â€“40 minutes, but many clients choose a shorter version to serve as a grand finale for an evening of activities.

### Indoor & Outdoor Options
The Celebrate America Laser Show can be held indoors or outdoors. If outdoors, EOP handles all required FAA paperwork and approvals. Please note that we want to start that process no less than 2 months prior to your show and the earlier the better in case adjustments are needed.

## Why Choose a Laser Show?

Laser shows are more than just beautiful and unique, they're strategic.

### Strategic Benefits
- **Audience Engagement**: Because the lasers are projected over the audience, not straight up into the sky, they naturally draw people into a specific space
- **Boost Foot Traffic**: This makes them an excellent tool for boosting foot traffic in places like downtown areas, parks, stadiums, or festival grounds
- **Safety First**: They're also the safest entertainment in the sky â€” with no pyrotechnics, no loud explosions, and no physical objects or debris in the air. The only thing in the sky is light!

## Want to Make It Even Bigger And Get More Value From Your Investment?

Once we are already at your venue, adding additional experiences become quite cost effective. Our most popular is:

### Neon Nights
This high-energy experience turns your event into an interactive celebration that can last for hours. Participants don't just watch â€” they become a part of the show. And that interaction is what creates lifelong memories.

**Think of it this way:**
- If you record a laser show today, will you watch it with your family 10 years from now? Honestlyâ€¦â€¦probably not.
- But if you record your kids dancing with grandma under lasers, black lights, and maybe even in a foam pit...
- You'll save that video to the cloud so you never lose it.

### Available Neon Nights Themes:
- **Blast to the Past**
- **A Mix of Past and Current**
- **The Many Genres of American Music**
- **Custom themes available upon request**

## Rates & Booking Info

### Pricing Philosophy
Just like weddings, laser shows are highly scalable. Every event has different goals, venues, crowds, and budgets. We're here to help you find the right fit without overpaying or settling for something that doesn't match your vision.

We don't offer one-size-fits-all pricing because we don't believe in forcing a sale that doesn't serve your needs. Instead, a short conversation helps us give you a fair and accurate quote.

### Cost-Effective Facts
- **Good to know**: Show length typically doesn't have a major impact on cost. Whether your show runs 10 minutes or 40, most of the expense comes from setup, equipment, and staffing.
- **Extremely cost effective for additional shows and nights**: That is great news if you decide to run your show more than one night or have more than one show in a single night.
