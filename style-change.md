# Style Guide Reference

## Background & Color Palette
- Drop the all-black backgrounds
- Use light/white primary background
- Reserve dark strips or gradients only for accent sections (e.g., hero banner overlays)
- Eliminate neon-green body text
  - Use white text on dark accents
  - Use softer "emerald" or brand accent for buttons/links

## Typography
- Center only headings; left-align all body copy
- Standardize sizes:
  - 16px base font
  - 24-32px for H2/H1
  - Line-height ~1.6 for readability

## Hero Sections
- Consistent pattern:
  - Full-width image or short (≤10s) muted loop video
  - Maximum 60vh tall
  - White or semi-transparent overlay title
- All pages should start with hero image/video plus a single clear CTA

## Media Sizing
- Replace oversized photos/carousels with thumbnail grids (3-up or 4-up)
  - Click or lightbox to enlarge
- Move every page's highlight video to the top and lazy-load it
- Set a poster image for videos

## Spacing & Layout
- Reduce vertical scroll:
  - Trim large image heights
  - Shrink empty whitespace
- Add consistent section dividers:
  - Light grey bands instead of green lines, or
  - Slim green accent lines across every page (including Home) for consistency

## Buttons & Links
- One primary CTA color (brand emerald or similar) with high-contrast text
- Convert bullet features (e.g., Safety, Benefits lists) to clickable anchor links that smooth-scroll to detail sections

## Navigation & Footer
- Ensure desktop and mobile menus share the same green accent divider under nav bar
- Footer:
  - Light background
  - Include quick links, contact, and subtle accent strip
  - Avoid full neon green

## Accessibility & Contrast
- Meet WCAG contrast requirements—no neon on black for text
- Provide alt text and semantic headings
- Add "back to top" button for long pages
